{"name":"Robert Lynch","tagline":"I write code and code accessories.","body":"# Hi, my name is Robert\r\nI'm a sophomore Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Austin. I love coming up with effective and unique solutions to difficult problems in code. I spend a lot of free time hacking on my projects, mostly for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Google Glass](http://glass.google.com).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# My Projects\r\n\r\n### Paranoia and Paranoia-nodejs\r\nOne of the first applications I built was a manager for the community game \"Assassins\". The game works by first assigning a group of people \"targets\" in a circular fashion, and then creating a technique in which people can \"kill\" their targets, until one person remains, who is the winner. **Paranoia** is the original implementation, written almost solely in PHP using SQL for the database. Upon revisiting this project after it's initial creation, I made **Paranoia-nodejs**, a re-implementation in Node.js using MongoDB as the database.\r\n\r\n[View Paranoia on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/Paranoia)  \r\n[View Paranoia-nodejs on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/Paranoia-nodejs)\r\n\r\n### GlassNote\r\n**GlassNote** is a teleprompter and presentation remote for Google Glass I started development on during [HackTX](http://hacktx.com/) 2014. In its original form, it used **Strut-for-Glassnote**, a fork of [Strut](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut), for a presentation editor and viewer, and a Node.js server using [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) to communicate between Strut and Glass. I later rewrote the majority of the application stack, so it now uses Apple's Keynote as the presentation editor, communicating to Glass over HTTP requests via **KAAS**.\r\n\r\n[View GlassNote on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/GlassNote)  \r\n[View Strut-for-Glassnote on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/Strut-for-Glassnote)  \r\n[View KAAS on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/kaas)\r\n\r\n### Class Assignments\r\nThroughout my academic career, I have done a lot of development on class projects. These are the repositories contains the projects I have completed to date:\r\n* **cs-intro-assignments**: Intro to CS and Data Structures. This repo is not public due to University Policy. \r\n* **cs429-assignments**: Computer Architectures. This repo contains my implementation of an interpreter and assembler, a victim cache, and other projects regarding machine level operations. This repo is open since the lecturer does not teach any more.\r\n* **cs439-assignments**: Operating Systems. This repo contains my implementation of PintOS, an instructional operating system. Like the intro classes, the repository is not public.\r\n\r\n[View cs429-assignments on Github](https://github.com/BobertForever/cs429-assignments)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
