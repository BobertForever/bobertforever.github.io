<p>I'm a sophomore Computer Science major at the University of Texas at Austin. I love coming up with effective and unique solutions to difficult problems in code. I spend a lot of free time hacking on my projects, mostly for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://glass.google.com">Google Glass</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first applications I built was a manager for the community game "Assassins". The game works by first assigning a group of people "targets" in a circular fashion, and then creating a technique in which people can "kill" their targets, until one person remains, who is the winner. <strong>Paranoia</strong> is the original implementation, written almost solely in PHP using SQL for the database. Upon revisiting this project after its initial creation, I made <strong>Paranoia-nodejs</strong>, a re-implementation in Node.js using MongoDB as the database.</p>

<p><strong>GlassNote</strong> is a teleprompter and presentation remote for Google Glass I started development on during <a href="http://hacktx.com/">HackTX</a> 2014. In its original form, it used <strong>Strut-for-Glassnote</strong>, a fork of <a href="https://github.com/tantaman/Strut">Strut</a>, for a presentation editor and viewer, and a Node.js server using <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> to communicate between Strut and Glass. I later rewrote the majority of the application stack, so it now uses Apple's Keynote as the presentation editor, communicating to Glass over HTTP requests via <strong>KAAS</strong>.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic career, I have done a lot of development on class projects. These are the repositories contains the projects I have completed to date:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>cs-intro-assignments</strong>: Intro to CS and Data Structures. This repo is not public due to University Policy. </li>
<li>
<strong>cs429-assignments</strong>: Computer Architectures. This repo contains my implementation of an interpreter and assembler, a victim cache, and other projects regarding machine level operations. This repo is open since the lecturer does not teach any more.</li>
<li>
<strong>cs439-assignments</strong>: Operating Systems. This repo contains my implementation of PintOS, an instructional operating system. Like the intro classes, the repository is not public.</li>
